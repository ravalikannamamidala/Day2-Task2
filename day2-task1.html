    <dt>Kedaranath</dt>
    <dd>One of the most interesting features of the Kedarnath Temple is its unique lingam. Devotees believe Lord Shiva himself worship himself here. Unlike other lingams that are made of stone or metal, people believe it to be a natural rock formation in the shape of a lingam.</dd>
    <dt> Agra</dt>
    <dd>Agra is a city on the banks of the Yamuna river in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh</dd>
